= CRAY-Shasta Image Build Framework
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

== Getting Started

This repository contains the https://www.packer.io/[Packer] pipepline code for building CRAY High-Performance Computing as a Service (HPCaaS)
images for any distributable medium.

The listed software below will equip a local machine or buildserver to build for any medium (`.squashfs`, `.vbox`, and `.qcow2`).

=== Contributing

Each box in `boxes/` has several builders defined in the `.pkr.hcl` files.

These builders each invoke `provisioners` and contain `files/` that're sorted into various contexts:

* `common`
* `google`
* `metal`
* `foo`

All provisioner and file changes and additions should ideally go into `common`, the other groups such as `google` exist
to run specific commands necessary for Google Cloud Compute. Anything not in `common` should be kept as minimal as
possible as to keep consistency between our artifacts.

For example:

* Installing CEPH, and locking the kernel are actions we want to be the same across all artifact types (`common`).
* Installing and configuring iLO management software and daemons is something we do not have on any medium except for real hardware (`metal`).
* A meta file for a Google import should only exist on `google` artifacts.

For help deciding where something should go, please inquire within the https://app.slack.com/client/T02FUJE3F/ncn-devel[#ncn-devel] Slack channel.

=== Necessary Software

* `envsubst` (optional; for base layer builds)
* qemu
* libvirt (optional; for vagrant)
* packer
* virtualbox (optional; for virtualbox builds)

=== Media

Packer can intake any ISO, the sections below detail utilized base ISOs in CRAY HPCaaS.

For any ISO, copy it into the `iso/` directory.

==== SuSE Linux Enterprise

Files that have been tested and verified to work:

These can be downloaded from https://www.suse.com/download/sles/

* `SLE-15-SP2-Full-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso`
* `SLE-15-SP3-Full-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso`
* `SLE-15-SP3-Online-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso`

=== Repositories

You will need access to the appropriate SLES repositories in the form of official access, self-hosted access, or the provided Nexus access.

If you are using the default internal servers then you only need to pass `artifactory_user` and `artifactory_token` as variables with the packer command.

- `-var 'artifactory_user=user' -var 'artifactory_token=token'`

Furthermore, there may be additional repos used that are defined in `csm-rpms` which is checked out in the Quick Start section. You may be required to replace some or all of these files in `csm-rpms/repos/*.repos` to work with your environment.

==== Working with Git Vendor

If you need to adjust the version of `csm-rpms` in your repo, or make changes to the `csm-rpms` code base, you will
need to install git-vendor, which uses git submodules for managing dependencies.

* `git vendor list` will show you the managed repos
* `git vendor update csm-rpms release/1.2` will checkout the `release/1.2` branch of `csm-rpms`
* All code for `csm-rpms` is stored in the `vendor` directory

Both `csm-rpms` and `metal-provision` are vendored.

== Build Steps

=== Setup

* Install packer
+
[source,bash]
----
# macos
brew install packer
----
* Install qemu
* Optionally install Vagrant and libvirt for local builds of Vagrant boxes

If you are building QEMU images in MacOS, you will need to adjust specific QEMU options:

* MacOS requires HVF for acceleration
* MacOS uses Cocoa for output
* `-var 'qemu_display=cocoa' -var 'qemu_accelerator=hvf'`

[#_prerequisites]
=== Prerequisites

* Define variables needed for the NCN build.
+
[source,bash]
----
export SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD=
----
+
[source,bash]
----
# NOTE: This is only necessary for building the base layer.
export SLES15_REGISTRATION_CODE=
----
+
[source,bash]
----
export ARTIFACTORY_USER=
----
+
[source,bash]
----
export ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN=
----
* Create and source an `environment` file for reuse.
+
[source,bash]
----
envsubst < scripts/environment.template > scripts/environment
. scripts/environment
----

[#_base_layer]
==== Base Layer

This requires following the <<_prerequisites>> section.

.Steps for building
. Download a base to start with, this example downloads a base ISO from CSM's Artifactory.
+
[source,bash]
----
media=SLE-15-SP3-Online-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso
mkdir iso
curl -f -o iso/$media https://$ARTIFACTORY_USER:$ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN@artifactory.algol60.net/artifactory/os-images/${media}
----
. Render the `autoinst.xml` and `autoinst-google.xml` files.
+
[source,bash]
----
./scripts/setup.sh
----
. Build.
+
[source,bash]
----
packer build -only=qemu.sles15-base -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' boxes/sles15-base
----

Once the images are built, the `.qcow2` and `.box` files will be placed in the `output-sles15-base` and `output-sles15-base-vagrant` directory, respectively.

[#_common_layer]
==== Common Layer

If the <<_base_layer>> section was followed, then this layer can be built as is.If the base layer is being skipped, then a stable base needs to be downloaded.

.Steps for building
. Download a stable base if one wasn't created by completing the <<_base_layer>> section.
+
* Qemu
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir output-sles15-base-qemu
curl -f -o output-sles15-base-qemu/sles15-base.qcow2 https://$ARTIFACTORY_USER:$ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN@artifactory.algol60.net/artifactory/csm-images/stable/sles15-base/\\[RELEASE\\]/sles15-base-\\[RELEASE\\].qcow2
----
+
[sidebar]
VirtualBox is not listed for two reasons; VirtualBox is not published to Artifactory, and VirtualBox uses the `.qcow2` file from qemu.
. Build
* Qemu
+
[source,bash]
----
packer build -only=qemu.ncn-common -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' -var 'artifactory_user=$ARTIFACTORY_USER' -var 'artifactory_token=$ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN' boxes/ncn-common
----
* VirtualBox
+
[source,bash]
----
packer build -only=virtualbox-ovf.ncn-common -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' -var 'artifactory_user=$ARTIFACTORY_USER' -var 'artifactory_token=$ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN' boxes/ncn-common
----

Once the image has built, the `.qcow2` file will be placed in the `output-ncn-common` directory.

==== Non-Compute Node Image Layer

If the <<_common_layer>> section was followed, then this layer can be built as is. If the common layer is being skipped, then a stable common needs to be downloaded.

This builds a the following NCN artifacts:

* kubernetes
* pre-install-toolkit
* storage-ceph

.Steps for building
. Download a stable common if one wasn't created by completing the <<_common_layer>> section.
+
* Qemu
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir output-ncn-common-qemu
curl -f -o output-ncn-common-base-qemu/ncn-common.qcow2 https://$ARTIFACTORY_USER:$ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN@artifactory.algol60.net/artifactory/csm-images/stable/ncn-common/\\[RELEASE\\]/ncn-common-\\[RELEASE\\].qcow2
----
. Build.
* Qemu
+
[source,bash]
----
packer build -only=qemu.* -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' -var 'artifactory_user=$ARTIFACTORY_USER' -var 'artifactory_token=$ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN' boxes/ncn-node-images
----
* VirtualBox
+
[source,bash]
----
packer build -only=virtualbox-ovf.* -var 'ssh_password=$SLES15_INITIAL_ROOT_PASSWORD' -var 'artifactory_user=$ARTIFACTORY_USER' -var 'artifactory_token=$ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN' boxes/ncn-node-images`
----

Once the images has built, the `.qcow2` file will be placed in the `output-ncn-node-images` directory.

=== Artifacts

Each layer creates a product, and each product is created in various formats. These formats cater to certain contexts.

.Artifact Types
- Google artifacts (published directly to Google Cloud)
- Metal artifacts (only produced by the last layer, `ncn-node-images`, and published to Artifactory)
- VirtualBox artifacts (not built by any automation nor published anywhere)

Each type is the _same_ with some exceptions.

==== Latest Artifacts

The latest artifacts can be fetched by the following commands.

. Set the credentials

----

=== Versioning

The version of the build is passed with the `packer build` command as the `artifact_version` var. This
is a unique identifier consisting of a shortened git hash and a datestamp.

* If no version is passed to the builder then a version is generated in the format of `[COMMIT]-[TIMESTAMP]`.
* Feature artifacts use the versioning format of `[COMMIT]-[TIMESTAMP]`.
** These publish to `unstable`.
* Pre-release artifacts use the versioning format of `A.B.C-X`, where `A.B.C` is the anticipated, stable release that this pre-release is for.
** These publish to `unstable`.
* A release artifact uses the versioning format of `A.B.C`.
** These publish to `stable`.
