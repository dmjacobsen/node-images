# This is a list of extra Subject Alternative Names (SANs) to add to the host
# certificate that is generated by this role. If this certificate is to be used
# on any other hosts, add them to this list so that clients can perform host
# validation.
# See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.6 for a description of
# SAN and the format of the string.
# The host certificate is generated with the following SANs:
# - All of the hosts in the `storage` group from the ansible inventory.
# - All of the items in the host_certificate_extra_altnames list.
